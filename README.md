## **About me** 🚀

*38 years old* [Vinnytsia College - (2003 - 2005)]

**No matter what technologies you are using, the goal is to create a reusable, straightforward, high-performance project that can be easily scaled and supported by a small team.**

I specialize in designing high-quality, innovative, and efficient E-commerce solutions using Salesforce Commerce Cloud. By leveraging my expertise in the latest best practices, patterns, and algorithms, I optimize development processes and streamline coding for my team.

In addition to my technical skills, I have extensive experience in management, including team leadership, task analysis, development planning, issue resolution, interface design, code review, and documentation maintenance. With my well-rounded skill set, I am equipped to lead successful e-commerce projects from conception to deployment.
